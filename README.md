# vehiculum

This project is the same as the static html one. I created this one before I realized that no frameworks where allowed. However, I wanted to share it anyway, so you could see how this project could be structure as a vue.js project.

Here I used vue-cli in which I have also vue-router, this way we could extend the project, add further pages and features.

Atomic design, BEM and ES6 is the standard. Eslint rules from airbnb have been implemented, however, there are still a lot of warnings.

This project is not responsive, only shows the vue for a desktop.
